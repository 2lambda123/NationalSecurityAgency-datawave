# To work with this site locally...

## Prerequisites

- Ruby: <https://rvm.io>
- Jekyll: <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/>
- Site Source: <https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency/datawave>

## Performing site updates

- See in-line documentation in [_config.yml](_config.yml)
- See [scripts/publish-new-releases](scripts/publish-new-releases) to automate publishing of 'Project News' updates for new DataWave releases 

## Build and run the site

```bash
 # Clone datawave and pull/checkout only the gh-pages branch...
 
 $ git clone --single-branch \
   --branch gh-pages \
   https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/datawave.git \
   datawave-gh-pages
   ...
 $ cd datawave-gh-pages
  
 # Build and run the site using the preview server with overridden baseurl (see baseurl configuration
 # notes in _config.yml for more info), and auto-sync site changes via '--watch' option ...
  
 $ bundle update # Optional
 $ bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl '' --watch
 
 # By default, JEKYLL_ENV=development (see details below)
 
 # Now browse to http://localhost:4000/
 
```

## Development Mode vs Production Mode

When you build/run the site locally, you'll automatically be in development mode, i.e., **JEKYLL_ENV=development**.
So, if you want to build the production site, then you must set **JEKYLL_ENV=production**, which is the value set by
GitHub when it builds and renders the site automatically (i.e., whenever new commits are pushed) 

Currently, the only difference between dev and prod mode is that dev mode will enable display of *TODO*, *WIP*,
and other dev-related *tags* and *includes* throughout the site.

To build and run locally in production mode...

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl '' --watch

```

For example, you can add dev-only content to the site as follows...

```
{% if jekyll.environment != 'production' %}
   <h1>I'm in development!</h1> 
{% endif %}

```
