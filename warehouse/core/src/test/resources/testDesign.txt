TokenSpecParser - normally takes format of
"a" : 1

Other Filters - take format of
label a=1

EdgeColumnQualifierTokenFilter uses format 1.
The other filter uses format 2.  Example lowside?
EdgeColumnQualifierTokenFilter should now be able to use format 2.

I want to confirm that EdgeColumnQualifierTokenFilter can inherit a matchPattern from a filter that uses format 2.

1. Create a parent configuration file that uses format 2.
2. Create a child configuration file that extends the parent, using EdgeColumnQualifierTokenFilter.  Have it override a few things.
Perhaps: Create another child configuration file that extends the parent, using ExampleFilter.  Have it override a few things as well.

Create some data to be run through the configuration file 2 filter.
Verify the data is aged off in a way that could only be done by matching a rule in the parent.
Verify the data is aged off in a way that could only be done by matching the overridden rule from the child.
